## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Forms Implementation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - React Hook Form + Zod basic example (input, select, checkbox)
   - Validation messages + disabled/submit states
   - Currently just a placeholder

2. **States Panel Enhancement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Add actual state examples (loading, error, success, empty states)
   - Currently only has a link to home page

3. **Advanced Components** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Data Table with advanced features
   - Sidebar component
   - Chart integration

## üí° Recommendations

- **Immediate**: Complete the Forms panel implementation as it's the only major missing piece
- **Enhancement**: Add proper state examples to the States panel instead of just a link
- **Documentation**: Consider adding accessibility notes for interactive components (focus, ARIA)
- **Testing**: Add component tests for each demo panel
- **Future**: Consider storybook integration for visual regressions
- **Organization**: Keep each demo self-contained and minimal, link to upstream shadcn documentation for advanced usage

## üìä Current Status

- **Total Components**: 19 panels
- **Fully Implemented**: 17/19 (89%)
- **Partially Implemented**: 1/19 (States panel)
- **Placeholder Only**: 1/19 (Forms panel)
